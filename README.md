Current lean code verifies the theorem described in the paper is correct within the constraints:

This implementation is valid for any:
- System size N > 0 
- Arbitrary coupling strength J
- Site-dependent chemical potentials
- Periodic boundary conditions

But for the standard 1D lattice gas model with site-dependent chemical potential, this proof is complete and mathematically rigorous.

I will keep working on this and try to get to full generalization for:

- Multi-dimensional lattices
- Other boundary conditions (open, anti-periodic)
- Beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions
- Different spin dimensions
