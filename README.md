current lean code verifies the theorem described in the paper is correct within the constraints:

This implementation is valid for any:
- System size N > 0 
- Arbitrary coupling strength J
- Site-dependent chemical potentials
- Periodic boundary conditions

- i will keep working on this and try to get to full generalization
